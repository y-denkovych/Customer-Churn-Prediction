## 📝 Project Description
#### We are a team of machine learning engineers and we’ve won a bid with “Telco” to create a machine learning model that will predict customer churn.
#### Customer churn prediction is an emerging phenomenon that enables companies to take the necessary steps to retain clients thus retaining constant revenue.


## ⚙️ Data Pipeline
#### E - extracting CSV files from Kaggle
#### T - Checking for null values and data types, dropping irrelevant coluns, converting categorical data to numeric
#### L - Loading to PostgreSQL database
